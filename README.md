## Sample Proposal for 431 Project A

Dr. Love built a sample Project A proposal using 2019 CHR Data and states not available to you. Please make good use of these documents.

- Dr. Love's [R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-projectA-sample-proposal/blob/main/love_sample_projA_proposal.Rmd) is a strong starting point for the development of your proposal. 
- The resulting HTML file can be viewed at https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projA-sample-proposal-431-2022, which may be easier for you to read and will also show you what your final result should look like.
